# This module implements channels, which are undirectional connections
# between a provider and an arbitrary number of subscribers. The
# provider broadcasts data to all subscribers by setting (replacing the
# current content) or adding the data content of a channel.
#
# There are both complete implementations available (currently only
# NumericChannel) and it is possible to inherit from AbstractChannel and
# implement various abstract methods.
#
# In most cases related to data acquisition, NumericChannel is the
# optimal choice.

    This is probably the most commonly used channel throughout the

    of AbstractChannel.

    The buffer layout is optimised for frequent insertions rather than
    retrieval. Such an operation may therefore be a rather expensive
    operation (due to the need to compact various data structures) and
    should be avoided during a measurement run. Consider blocking
    between steps in this case.

    In addition to the parameters of AbstractChannel, a shape parameter
    should be provided to determine the dimensionality of the data in
    this channel, which defines the data type for the dataAdded
    callback.

        0: scalar data, addData/dataAdded uses int
        1: numpy array of shape(X,) with X being an arbitrary sample

        N(>1): numpy array of shape(X,N) with X being an arbitrary
            sample amount, addData/dataAdded uses array(X,N)

    There is also the option to provide an interval [a,b] via
    setInterval() that guarentees that for all samples x in this
    channel: a <= x <= b. Subscribers may use the rangeChanged callback
    to be notified of any changes to this interval. This range has to
